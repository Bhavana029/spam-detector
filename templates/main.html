    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>In today's digital world, unwanted messages—commonly known as spam—pose a serious threat to personal privacy, productivity, and online safety. Spam messages often contain misleading content, phishing links, or fraudulent offers intended to deceive users. With the rise in mobile communication and email usage, it has become crucial to identify and filter out such messages automatically. This web application utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and classify messages as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). By training on thousands of real-world examples, our model learns to detect patterns, keywords, and common spam indicators with high accuracy. This tool provides users a simple yet powerful way to protect themselves from digital clutter and potential scams.</p>
      <p>Spam messages are unwanted communications that often appear in emails, SMS, and other digital platforms. These messages are usually sent in bulk and can range from harmless advertisements to dangerous scams. Spammers aim to deceive users into clicking links, sharing personal information, or downloading malicious files. Because sending spam is cheap and fast, spammers can target thousands of people at once, often hiding behind fake identities and using convincing language to appear legitimate.</p>
      <p>Over time, spam has evolved from basic promotional texts to sophisticated scams that are difficult to detect. Many messages are crafted to look official or urgent, increasing the likelihood that recipients will respond or take action. This poses a serious risk to individuals and organizations alike, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and financial loss.</p>
      <p>Beyond technical issues, spam also affects user trust and digital experiences. Constant exposure to spam can be frustrating and mentally exhausting, especially for people who are less familiar with technology. As the digital world expands, the need to recognize and protect against spam becomes increasingly important. By staying aware of spam's tactics and threats, users can better safeguard their personal information and maintain safe communication practices online.</p>
